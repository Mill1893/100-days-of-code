### Day 0: December 31, 2016
**Before I Begin**: This will be something new for me, I have coded for school before but never using the standard technologies of the industry. I actually am a Computer Science major at a 4 year university, but the curriculum is more based on a broad range of topics including coding, and I really enjoy coding. If I'm going to do this I want to do it right, so I'm going to learn git and github before I begin so that I may use them throughout the process, I will also keep a log of project ideas at the beginning of my log so I will have something to reference when I've run out of ideas. I want to first start with a portfolio page that I can use to showcase my work. I have a project I'm doing with through my school with a professor, while I would prefer to not count that time towards this challenge, I feel I may have to due to the time sensitivity of the project. I hope that I am able to maintain focus throughout the 100 days and want to be a better coder after it is finished. I will also update my resources file periodically to keep track of the resources I've used. While many of my resources are free, I have purchased some [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) courses that I also recommend. I will update this page again on the 3rd.
