## Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Before I Begin**: This will be something new for me, I have coded for school before but never using the standard technologies of the industry.
I actually am a Computer Science major at a 4 year university, but the curriculum is more based on a broad range of topics including coding, and I really enjoy coding.
If I'm going to do this I want to do it right, so I'm going to learn git and github before I begin so that I may use them throughout the process, I will also keep a log of project ideas at the beginning of my log so I will have something to reference when I've run out of ideas.
I want to first start with a portfolio page that I can use to showcase my work.
I have a project I'm doing with through my school with a professor, while I would prefer to not count that time towards this challenge, I feel I may have to due to the time sensitivity of the project.
I hope that I am able to maintain focus throughout the 100 days and want to be a better coder after it is finished.
I will also update my resources file periodically to keep track of the resources I've used. While many of my resources are free, I have purchased some [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) courses that I also recommend. I will update this page again on the 3rd.


## Day 1: January 3, 2017

**What I Did**: I began by creating a repo on Github for my portfolio. I then used Atom to create an index html file and added Bootstrap and some google fonts for my own creative purposes. Created a navbar and began on the meat of the webpage with a jumbotron front page and an about page underneath.

**What I Learned**: Coding in HTML is not so much problem solving as it is memorization of when to use what where. Bootstrap has very specialized classes for certain things so I had to constantly look up different classes to match what I was thinking. Once the classes are memorized I imagine the process will go a lot more quickly.

**Next Time**: I hope to get more of the text I want on the page, I might start working on the styling tomorrow also. I imagine that will take quite awhile in order for me to get to a point where I am satisfied.

## Day 2: January 4, 2017

**What I Did**: I installed Node.js on my computer so I could use the live-server application with my Atom text editor. I added a stylesheet and messed around with trying to get things where I wanted them.

**What I Learned**: I now know that I should take each section one at a time with styling so that I can get it the way I want it before I move on. HTML only looks so pretty(not at all) so I need to make sure I get the styling down before I continue making more content. Also live-server is pretty cool.

**Next Time**: Hopefully finish up fixing my styling for my jumbotron area of the page and then move on to styling the about section.

## Day 3: January 5, 2017

**What I Did**: Got rid of a lot of what I had, added some styling to my jumbotron, used internal styling, might switch to external styling later.

**What I Learned**: Inline styling can be easier to manage for smaller pages, but gets long quickly, however it is nice to have everything all in one file.

**Next Time**:Continue working on the project, hopefully start adding placeholders for projects I can change when I get projects to add, hopefully add a bootstrap panel.
